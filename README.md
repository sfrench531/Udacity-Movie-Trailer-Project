Movie Trailer Website Project
July 25, 2016

Files required:

entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
media.py

This project creates an HTML webpage on which the trailers from some
selected movies ("Fantastic Mr. Fox", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind",
"Bernie", "Nightcrawler", "Short Term 12", and "Welcome to Me")can be played. 

Executing the entertainment_center.py module will be sufficient to create the 
HTML document and open it in a web browser.
